# AQI Prediction Model - AICTE-CYCLE-4
AQI- Air Quality Index Prediction is the process of estimating the air quality in the future. It's important for public health, environmental management, and urban planning. 
An AQI (Air Quality Index) prediction model is a system designed to forecast the air quality in a specific location based on various environmental factors. AQI is a measure used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecasted to become, typically ranging from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating worse air quality.
